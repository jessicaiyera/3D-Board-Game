# 3D-Board-Game

## Overview
In my first Computer Science semester, I developed a strategy board game where players aim to maneuver their pieces into designated "sinks" on the board. Successfully positioning and sinking the pieces requires strategic planning and problem-solving skills.

## Features
- **Strategic Gameplay:** Engage in deep strategic decisions as you plan several moves ahead to best your opponent.
- **3D Board Design:** Experience the game in three dimensions, which adds complexity and visual depth to the gameplay.

## How to Play

### Game Overview
This strategy board game is designed for two players, each taking turns to strategically position their pieces into designated "sinks" on a 3D board. The aim is to be the first to sink all your pieces.

### Rules
- **Number of Players:** 2
- **Starting the Game:** The player with the light stones begins the game.
- **Gameplay:** Players alternate turns. During each turn, a player must make two moves.
- **Objective:** Maneuver your pieces across the board to align them with sink points.
- **Winning the Game:** The game continues with players alternating turns until one player successfully sinks 4 or more of their pieces, thereby winning the game.

### Player Turns
1. **Initiate:** Each turn begins with the player deciding which piece to move towards a sink.
2. **Move:** Execute two moves. Each move can be advancing a piece towards a sink.
3. **Strategy:** Plan your moves to block your opponent or hasten your own pieces to the sinks.

### Ending the Game
- The game ends when one player has no more pieces left on the board, having successfully sunk all their pieces.
- Alternatively, a player loses if they are unable to make a legal move when their turn comes.
